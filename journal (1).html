            <h2>Do you know its other name?</h2>
            <p>The newborn baby's hair is light yellow, eyes are big and bright, and the fingers (toes) of its limbs are red. The most beautiful thing is that its lips are cherry red, just like a girl with lipstick. In Yunnan, the local people also call it snow monkey or white monkey. This may be because it lives in the alpine snow zone, or because its baby's whole body is light white. In addition, the Tibetan compatriots of the origin call it "Zhijie" and the Bai compatriots call it "white wart", which means big white monkey with the smell of mutton.</p>
