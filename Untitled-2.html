            <h3>Number of monkeys</h3>
            <p>In 1987, it was estimated that there were no more than 1000 Yunnan snub nosed monkeys. In 1993, it was estimated that there were about 1000 Mangkang monkeys in Tibet. [2] During 1987-1994, there were 13 wild monkey groups, about 1500. [9] In 2003, Kunming Institute of zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences found that the number of this species increased to nearly 1700. [10] The results of investigation in October 2004 showed that there are 15 groups of Yunnan snub nosed monkeys in the wild, and the total population is about 1, Among them, there are more than 300 Yunnan snub nosed monkeys in Mangkang National Nature Reserve of Tibet, about 1000 in Baima Snow Mountain National Nature Reserve of Yunnan, about 150 in Yunling Provincial Nature Reserve, and about 200 in Yulong, Lanping and Jianchuan counties of Yunnan There is also a group at the junction of Mangkang County, Tibet, with a number of about 80. [11] In the world, the total population in 2006 is estimated to be less than 2000, and the number of adult individuals is less than 1000, showing a downward trend.

            On August 7, 2013, the Sino French biologist joint mission revealed to the reporter that the number of Yunnan snub nosed monkeys in China has increased to more than 3000 after several days of field investigation and analysis. </p>

            <h3>Ecological impact</h3>
            <p>According to historical records, Yunnan snub nosed monkeys were widely distributed in ancient China. Due to the influence of human activities, they gradually retreated to the corner of the border between Yunnan and Tibet and lived in the alpine coniferous forest belt near the glacier snow line all the year round. There are steep slopes and deep cliffs, and the geographical environment and climate conditions are very bad. Only 13 natural populations of Yunnan snub nosed monkey (about 1000-1500) have been identified. They live in Yunling mountains between Jinsha River and Lancang River. The administrative divisions are Mangkang in Tibet, Deqin, Weixi, Lanping and Lijiang in Yunnan. The distribution area is about 20000 square kilometers. These natural populations are isolated from each other and distributed like islands, so gene exchange between them is impossible. Yunnan snub nosed monkey is on the verge of extinction. Conservation biology believes that there is a kind of species called "key species", which plays a leading role in the ecosystem. The rise and fall of key species directly affect the rise and fall of other species in the system. The key species in an ecosystem are often plants. For example, the key species in the Yunling mountains are spruce and fir, which are related to the survival of countless species in the forest, including Yunnan snub nosed monkey. Therefore, once these two tree species are destroyed, the whole forest ecosystem will fall apart.</p>

            <h3>Degenerated population</h3>
            <p>When the ferocious predators in Yunling mountains are extinct and on the verge of extinction, only the most dangerous and terrible "people" are left as the natural enemies of Yunnan snub nosed monkey. Due to the continuous deforestation, the habitat of Yunnan snub nosed monkey is rapidly destroyed, and the large forests that used to be connected together are cut to pieces and distributed as arc islands. The natural populations of 13 Yunnan snub nosed monkeys were isolated from each other, and gene exchange between them was impossible, resulting in inbreeding and population degradation. In addition, the residents of Yunnan snub nosed monkey distribution area are Tibetan, Lisu, Yi, Naxi, Bai, Pumi and many other ethnic groups. Most of them have traditional hunting habits, especially the hunting customs of Lisu. The Yunnan snub nosed monkey, an endangered species, has little tolerance for hunting. Experts believe that the situation of Yunnan snub nosed monkey is similar to that of gibbon. The loss of every 100 Monkeys in one year should not exceed one female and one larva to ensure the development of the population. Therefore, poachers are the biggest threat to its survival</p>
